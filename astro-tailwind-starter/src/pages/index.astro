Designed for convenience, it allowed compact, pocket-sized cameras to thrive, making photography more accessible than ever. However, the small negative size and imprecise film transport limited image quality, keeping 110 film in the realm of casual snapshots rather than professional photography. Despite its popularity, the format faded with the rise of digital cameras, though a nostalgic revival in 2012 by Lomography proved that 110 film still holds a special place in photographic history.</p>

        <p class="text-center max-w-lg">Kodak launched 110 film in 1972, making cameras easy to load. Drop-in cassettes removed threading hassles, simplifying photography. The small 13×17mm negatives allowed compact, pocketable cameras. Despite convenience, the tiny frames made high-quality prints difficult.</p>

        <p class="text-center max-w-lg ">110 film quickly gained popularity for its simplicity and small size. Most cameras had fixed focus, single shutter speed, and plastic lenses. Film latitude helped compensate for exposure and focus limitations. Poor print quality kept it from competing with larger film formats.</p>

        <p class="text-center max-w-lg  ">Loose tolerances & plastic cassettes limited 110 film's precision. The film transport mechanism had too much play for sharp images. High-end cameras couldn't overcome the flaws of the cassette design. As a result, 110 remained an amateur-oriented, low-quality format.</p>

        <p class="text-center max-w-lg ">By the ‘90s, 110 film production declined as demand dropped. Kodak and Fuji continued making it, but digital was taking over. APS and disc film aimed to replace it but failed to gain traction. In 2009, Fuji ceased production, marking the format's near end.</p>

        <img class="w-xs" src={image3.src} alt="Image 3"/>
        <p class="text-center max-w-lg">Lomography revived 110 film in 2012 with new B&W and color. Their releases included Orca, Tiger, and Peacock slide films. Nostalgic photographers embraced it despite its known drawbacks. 110 outlived APS and disc film, proving its enduring appeal.</p>
